# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I have used Gemini API for Assigning the tasks to the employees automatically.
Here is a brief description about my project .

Manager Dashboard

The Manager Dashboard serves as the control center for managers to oversee team operations. It includes the following features:

Task Overview: To view  all the tasks assigned to team members, including details like task ID, description, status, assigned employee, and deadline.

Modify Tasks: Managers can easily modify task details such as reassigning tasks to different employees, updating deadlines.

Employee Management: The dashboard allows managers to view employee details, including their workload, skills, and availability. Managers can track how many tasks each employee is handling, making it easier to balance workloads.

Task Assignment: Managers can assign new tasks to employees directly from the dashboard. It will be assigned by the Gemini API response directly to the eligible employee

Real-Time Updates: The dashboard reflects changes in real-time, ensuring that all users are up-to-date with the latest information.

EMPLOYEE DASHBOARD 

employee can view their tasks and update the task status whethere it is in pending,in progress or completed.
